This is a project I developed using React, Typescript, and Sass. It allows users to search for a pokemon from any generation and view its stats and details.

Pokedex utilises the [pokenode-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pokenode-ts) wrapper for the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) which provides pokemon information and images. The user can type in the name of a pokemon and it will return type information and base stats such as HP, Attack, and Defense. The design is inspired by traditional pokedexs with a slight twist to allow the app to be responsive for both mobile and desktop.

I decided to use the [React Bulma Components](https://react-bulma.dev/en) library so I could easily use all the capabilities of [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) using components in a declarative way. Bulma is a simple lightweight CSS framework and the Card component allowed me to easily create the pokedexs layout and look.
